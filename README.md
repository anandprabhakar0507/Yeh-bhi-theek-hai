Ratatoutille.com (Online Food Ordering System) has two interfaces. One is for the admin/manager to sign-up and login and the other one is for the customer to order food. The customer can login to their accounts and see the food items available. These food items belong to a specific menu which are specific to different restaurants and can be set up in the site only by the restaurant admin/manager interface. The manager can update the food items anytime he wishes to for their restaurant. On ordering a specific food item(quantity can be entered, cost and picture of food item is shown) the order details goes to the corresponding restaurant and they get notified. The customer can edit or delete their choices of food items. Eventually log out by paying the amount calculated.
